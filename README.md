# SIMULATION OF THE FLIGHT OF A WATER ROCKET

This project aims to develop a simulation of the flight of a water rocket by modeling the different phases of its flight. 
The objective is to analyze the influence of parameters on the maximum altitude reached and to determine an optimal set of parameters to maximize this altitude with a defined tank.

Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed, then install the required libraries:
- pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
